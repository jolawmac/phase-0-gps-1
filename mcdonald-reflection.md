1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? 
My main struggle was making sure I had the correct commands for the right job. I had to work slow at first to make sure I remembered each command and what they do. Also, I struggled with making sure I had the right file or branch name listed when doing work. 

2. What concepts were clarified during GPS? 
I'd say the most clarity I had was making sure which file or branch I was working in was the right one for the job. I was a bit confused on calling up, creating, and working in various files/folders/branches. Both the guide and my partner helped clear up the confusion as we walked through the lessons.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked my partner several questions inside GitHub just to make sure I was doing the right things. Guide helped also during this time. There were also questions in parts 4 and 5 that we were able to google and find the answers. 

4. What still confuses you about Git?
I don't think I'm confused about any of it. I think it will get easier the more I work in it. My biggest issue is remembering the correct commands.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My experience was awesome! The guide did great in explaining everything thoroughly and helping when we were stuck. My partner did a great job in assisting me and allowing me to do my own thing at the same time. I felt like a real coder! I learned so much during this first GPS not only about Git but also about pairing. Great experience all the way around. I know more of what to expect next time.
