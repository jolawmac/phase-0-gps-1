# GPS 1.1 Reflection
## Jason Lorentzen

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

While the basic git purpose made a lot of sense, working with the correct syntax and understanding the nuances of each command can be challenging. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Our guide clarified the protocol for pushing changes to the Github repository (add, commit, push).

My pair and I did some research to figure out fetching and merging syntax, which I think helped clarify more of the interaction between Git and Github generally as well.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked the guide about some of the ambiguity around the instructions for the exercise when I didn't know the answer. For instance, I wasn't sure if the provided 'git push origin master' command did any of the 'add' and 'commit' work. The guide was really helpful in clarifying these nuances.

I found going back and forth answering questions with my pair was helpful as hearing him articulate each answer gave me a different perspective on the git commands and process.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I still need to get more practice this week with understanding remotes and going back and forth between local and Github repositories.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

The experience was great. Our guide Neal laid out the session well at the beginning, and Josh and I had a very good interaction. The session felt a little slow -- I think both of us were getting used to the format and figuring out what to have prepared for the session and how to interact. However, being able to problem solve with someone is great relative to having to do it on your own! Looking forward to future sessions.
